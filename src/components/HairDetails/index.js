        The Goal of Wearing Protective Styles for Natural Hair Life insurance is
        used to protect our families when we die. Sunscreen is used to protect
        our skin from the adverse effects of the sun. Alarms systems are used to
        protect our homes from potential burglaries. Policemen carry firearms
        because they have a duty to protect society. This act of protecting
        things that are valuable to us is a common part of society. The basic
        concept is to preserve “something valuable” from damage, injury or harm.
        If one of your hair goals is to preserve your hair from damage, then you
        should incorporate protective styling into your natural hair regimen
        whenever possible. Protective styling is a concept that reduces ongoing
        manipulation of your hair, encourages growth retention and protects the
        ends of your hair strands, reducing knots and tangles.
